# ABC Select

## About

A chrome/FF extension to render the currently selected ABC into a modal, using @paulrosen's awesome [abcjs](https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs) library. It's currently in pre-beta and not available in any public registry, so you'll have to install it from file by cloning or downloading this repository.

All power to ABC! `/../,`
